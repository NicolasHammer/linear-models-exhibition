# Linear Models Exhibition
An exhibition of three models built from scratch: multiple linear regression, polynomial regression, and a perceptron.  Each of these models are compared against their respective scikit-learn counterpart: sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression, sklearn.preprocessing.PolynomialFeatures, and sklearn.linear_model.Perceptron.
